# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a programmer from China and have been engaged in front-end development since 2018. Front-end development is not only my work, but also a part of my life.

**Loclink** is my net name. Its meaning is: **My every line of code, I keep a close link**.

I love programming very much, and I am eager to learn programming technology in any field. The birth of new technology will make me very excited.

My favorite front-end framework is Vue. Its development mode makes me feel very comfortable.
